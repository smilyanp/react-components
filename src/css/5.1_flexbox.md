# Flexbox

Flexbox lays out **groups of items** in **one dimension**. Flexbox is good in taking a group of elements with varied sizing and returning the best possible layout for those items. It allows you to set flexible boundaries that hint to the browser on how the content should display. It can expand the items to fit all the available space or shrink them as necessary.

Layouts difficult to achieve with just floats and positioning:

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent
- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

Flexbox makes a lot of these tasks much easier.

## Flex parent and children

The parent element containing a set of children is given the `display: flex` property and is called flex container or the container. This makes it act as a block-level element in the way it interacts with the rest of the page. It groups it's children, which become flex items with some default properties applied.

## Flex model

The flex items are laid out along two axis.

![](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flex_terms.png)

- The `main axis` is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (vertically or horizontally)
  - The start and end of this axis are called `main start` and `main end`
- The `cross axis` is the one running perpendicular to the current flex direction
  - The start and end of this axis are called `cross start` and `cross end`
- The parent element that has `display: flex` set on it is called the flex container
- The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are called flex items

This is the main set of terms and basic concepts you need to understand to work with flexbox.

## Horizontal or vertical

Flexbox lets us change the direction in which the items are laid out on, or in other words which should be hte main axis. We can do that using the `flex-direction` property. By default, the value it uses is `flex-direction: row` but we can change it to `flex-direction: column`. The important thing to remember here is that that will depend on the language you are using for that page. So a rtl orientation will position the `main start` at the top-right of the page. Or in Japanese the default will position elements running vertically from top-left on the page.

## Wrapping

One common problem is that eventually you will run out of space on your page (especially in a LTR language with a flex-direction: row). This means that the flex items will start overflowing the available space of your flex container and that will put them outside of it.

To manage this flexbox allow us to tell the items to wrap and move on a new line when they run out of space.

We can do that using the `flex-wrap: wrap;` property.

You can see that the list of items will start going on a new row and creating a new group of items there. In the last row, the items will spread as wide as possible and divide the available space between them.

## Flex-flow

`flex-flow` is worth mentioning because it's a short-hand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`:

```
flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: wrap;
```

Is the same as

```
flex-flow: row wrap;
```

## Flex-items - flexible sizing

Sometimes we want to control how much of the available space one flex item takes versus the others in that group.

When we give each flex item the following property:

```
flex: 1;
```

The value of `1` here is a unitless proportion that indicates how much of the available space each item will receive. Since all items get the exact same amount (`1`) it doesn't matter if that value is higher or not.

They'll all take up an equal amount of the spare space left **after properties like padding and margin have been set**.

Now make the n-th item a higher proportion:

```
.item:nth-of-type(3) {
  flex: 2;
}
```

Now the third item will take up exactly twice the amount of space that the other items take. The total space (if we have 4 items) will be 5 units. Three of the items will have 1 unit of space and the last one will have 2 units, taking up 2/5 of the space.

We can also specify a minimum amount of space each item should take with:

```
flex: 1 300px;
```

In this case each item will take up at least 300px of space and if there is more available, they will take it.

The beauty of this is that if you add more items or resize the browser, flexbox will automatically use these rules and suggestions to make the layout "just work" and flexibly resize all the items.

## flex - short vs long hand

`flex:` is a shorthand that can accept up to 3 values, which are the equivalent of:

- The first part is the unitless value which is the equivalent of the `flex-grow:` property
- The second is also a unitless value, which is the equivalent of the `flex-shrink:` property
  - This becomes useful when flex items are overflowing the container. It tells the browser how much an item can shrink to prevent overflowing.
  - The inital value is `1`
- This is the third value, specifying the minimum size of the element, which is the equivalent of the `flex-basis:` property

### initial

`flex: initial`

The item is sized according to its width and height properties. It shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container, but does not grow to absorb any extra free space in the flex container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 0 1 auto".

### auto

`flex: auto`

The item is sized according to its width and height properties, but grows to absorb any extra free space in the flex container, and shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 1 1 auto".

### none

`flex: none`

The item is sized according to its width and height properties. It is fully inflexible: it neither shrinks nor grows in relation to the flex container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 0 0 auto".

### Note

The long-hand properties should generally be avoided (unless overriding). They can become confusing used individually and generally the shorthand is used with one of the global values or a positive unitless value.

## Alignment

You can align flex items along the `main` or `cross` axis. We can do that using:

```
align-items: ;
justify-content: ;
```

`align-items:` controls where flex items sit on **the cross axis**

- By default, the value is `stretch`, which stretches all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross axis
  - If the parent doesn't have a fixed height in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will become as tall as the tallest flex item
  - This is how you can easily get columns of equal height by default
- The `center` value causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis
  - This is how we can easily center items vertically (in a `flex-direction: row`)
- You can also have values like `flex-start` and `flex-end`, which will align all items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items

`align-self:` this lets you override the `align-items` value for a specific flex item element

```
.item:first-child {
  align-self: flex-end;
}
```

`justify-content:` it controls where the flex items sit on **the main axis**

- The default value is `flex-start`, which makes all the items sit at the start of the main axis
- `flex-end` will make them sit at the end
- `center` is also a value for `justify-content`. It'll make the flex items sit in the center of the main axis
- `space-around` distributes all the items evenly along the main axis with a bit of space left at either end
- `space-between` is very similar to `space-around` except that it doesn't leave any space at either end

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items

There is no `justify-self` in flexbox, because on the main axis flexbox deals with the flex items as a group. Once the amount of space required for each item is calculated, there is some leftover space and that's the space that `justify-content` controls.

There is one specific case where you might want to have a `justify-self` property - when you want to split the flex items and put some space between them. However, you can achieve that with `margin-[side]: auto`. This will use any available space to create a margin between the items and will not work when there's no space to use.

```
.box {
  display: flex;
}
.push {
    margin-left: auto;
}
```

```
<div class="box">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div class="push">Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

## Ordering

Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items without affecting the source order. This is another thing that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.

```
.item:first-child {
  order: 1;
}
```

- By default, all flex items have an order value of 0
- Flex items with higher specified order values will appear later in the display order than items with lower order values
- Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order
- You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items whose value is 0

## Gaps

`row-gap`

`column-gap`

`gap`

On the **main axis**, the `column-gap` property creates fixed size gaps between adjacent items

On the **cross axis** the `row-gap` property creates spacing between adjacent flex lines, therefore `flex-wrap` must also be set to `wrap` for this to have any effect.

`gap` is the shorthand for `row-gap: 10px;` and `column-gap: 20px;` - `gap: 10px 20px;`
