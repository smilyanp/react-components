FOLDER PER COMPONENT
One option is to have a folder per component

- src/
--- App/
----- index.js
----- component.js
----- test.js
----- style.css
--- List/
----- index.js
----- component.js
----- test.js
----- style.css
----- hooks.js
----- types.js
----- utils.js
----- story.js
----- ListItem/
------- index.js
------- component.js
------- test.js
------- style.css

This keeps styles and tests local to the component, so that everything is encapsulated in the same area.
To import the component you can simply import the index file `src/App`which will take the index.js
which can be exporting the component.js.
You can omit specifying the index when importing, because the resolver understand that that's the default file.

The other option is to keep a folder per component, but pre-pend the file name with the component name:

- src/
--- App/
----- index.js
----- App.js
----- App.test.js
----- App.style.css
--- List/
----- index.js
----- List.js
----- List.test.js
----- List.style.css
----- List.hooks.js
----- List.types.js
----- List.utils.js
----- List.story.js

This might make it easier when searching in the IDE for a component, but might also feel redundant and repetitive.

Ultimately, all the benefit is when you have collapsed the folders and can easily find your components:

- src/
--- App/
--- List/
