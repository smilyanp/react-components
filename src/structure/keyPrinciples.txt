- It's ok to have several components in the same file, as long as they are tightly coupled to each other
- When a component is re-usable it should be separated into a separate file
- Grow the structure as the project evolves, so you can move fast
- Don't nest components more than two folders deep. There are exceptions, but that's a good rule
- A project is constantly evolving and we need to maintain and change it respectively. It is not set in stone
